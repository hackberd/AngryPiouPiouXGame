different way to setting inputs type and handling them
- define Mobile Input Group and zones in Game.ini and reference command name (setup in Input.ini) to delegate name
- attach own delegate to event using the MobilePlayerInput class, setupinput function override
- override event bool OnMobileTouch(PlayerController InPC, Vector2D TouchLocation) and set bEnableMobileTouch=true in defaultproperties class
